# Bee

This repository provides an object detection model based on YOLOv8 for identifying and tracking bees. It uses bounding box predictions to detect bees in images or videos. The model is trained on a custom-labeled bee dataset containing about {} "Foraging", "Defense", "Fanning" and "Washboarding" labels.

The repository contains [results](yolov8-lstm) of the trained model.
